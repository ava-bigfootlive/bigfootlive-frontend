- [ ] Automatic stream recording (MP4/FLV)
- [ ] Post-stream processing (thumbnail generation)
- [ ] Cloud storage integration (AWS S3/Google Cloud)
- [ ] Recording playback and download
- [ ] Recording metadata and search

### 5. **Analytics Data Collection**
**Status: Real-time exists, needs post-event processing**

```bash
Priority: MEDIUM
Files: backend/src/services/AnalyticsProcessor.ts
Time: 2 days
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Stream analytics aggregation
- [ ] Viewer engagement metrics  
- [ ] Performance analytics (bitrate, quality, drops)
- [ ] Export capabilities (CSV, PDF reports)

### 6. **Content Management System**
**Status: Basic structure exists, needs expansion**

```bash
Priority: MEDIUM
Files: src/pages/content/
Time: 2-3 days
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Video library management
- [ ] Thumbnail and metadata editing
- [ ] Content categorization and tagging
- [ ] Search and filtering capabilities

---

## 🎯 **PHASE 3: Production Optimization (Week 3)**

### 7. **CDN Integration & Scaling**
**Status: Not implemented**

```bash
Priority: HIGH for production
Files: backend/infrastructure/
Time: 2-3 days
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] CloudFlare or AWS CloudFront integration
- [ ] Edge server deployment
- [ ] Geographic load balancing
- [ ] Bandwidth optimization

### 8. **Advanced Stream Features**
**Status: UI exists, needs backend implementation**

```bash
Priority: MEDIUM
Files: Multiple streaming components
Time: 3-4 days
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Multi-bitrate adaptive streaming
- [ ] Stream overlays and graphics
- [ ] Screen sharing capabilities
- [ ] Co-streaming and guest features

## 📊 **Technical Architecture**

### **Stream Flow:**
```
OBS Studio → RTMP Ingestion → SRS Media Server → HLS Transcoding → CDN → Viewers
                ↓
           Recording Service → Cloud Storage → Post-Processing
```

### **Event Container Architecture:**
```
Event Created → Container Spawned → SRS Instance → Stream Active → Analytics Collection
      ↓                                                              ↓
Post-Event Processing ← Recording ← Stream Ended ← Container Cleanup
```

### **File Structure Needed:**
```

## 🚀 **Immediate Next Actions**

### **This Week (Critical Path):**
1. **Day 1-2**: Set up SRS Docker container + RTMP→HLS pipeline
2. **Day 3**: Complete streaming API routes + frontend integration  
3. **Day 4**: Test end-to-end: OBS → Platform → Viewer
4. **Day 5**: Recording system implementation
5. **Weekend**: Post-event processing and analytics

### **Success Metrics:**
- [ ] ✅ Live stream from OBS to platform working
- [ ] ✅ Multiple simultaneous events supported
- [ ] ✅ Stream recordings automatically saved
- [ ] ✅ Real-time analytics during live events
- [ ] ✅ Post-event content management working

---

## 💡 **Key Technologies:**

- **SRS (Simple Realtime Server)**: RTMP ingestion + HLS delivery
- **FFmpeg**: Video processing and transcoding  
- **Docker**: Containerized stream instances
- **WebSockets**: Real-time stream status and analytics
- **MongoDB**: Event and recording metadata
- **Redis**: Caching and real-time data
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 or Google Cloud for recordings

This plan prioritizes the core streaming functionality that will make BigFoot Live actually functional for live events, with robust post-event processing for content management.
