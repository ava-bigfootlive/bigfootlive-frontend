# BigfootLive Subagents Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate and use Claude Code subagents in your BigfootLive development workflow for maximum productivity and code quality.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. **Activate Subagents in Claude Code**

In your Claude Code terminal, you can now use specialized subagents for different development tasks:

```bash
# Frontend development tasks
@bigfoot-frontend-dev Build a live stream viewer component with chat integration

# API integration and backend tasks  
@bigfoot-api-developer Design the WebSocket event system for real-time chat

# Code quality and review tasks
@bigfoot-quality-enforcer Review this component for accessibility compliance
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Subagent Usage Patterns

### **Frontend Development (@bigfoot-frontend-dev)**

**Best for:**
- Building React components for streaming features
- Implementing responsive designs for video interfaces
- Optimizing performance for video-heavy pages
- Ensuring accessibility compliance
- Integrating with design system components

**Example Commands:**
```bash
@bigfoot-frontend-dev Create a video player component with the following features:
- Adaptive quality controls
- Full-screen mode
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Mobile-optimized touch controls
- Screen reader accessibility

@bigfoot-frontend-dev Optimize the stream dashboard for mobile devices with:
- Touch-friendly navigation
- Reduced data usage
- Fast loading times
- Offline capabilities
```

### **Quality Enforcement (@bigfoot-quality-enforcer)**

**Best for:**
- Code review and standards compliance
- Setting up automated quality gates
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Security vulnerability detection
- Documentation quality assessment

**Example Commands:**
```bash
@bigfoot-quality-enforcer Review this video player component for:
- TypeScript type safety
- React best practices
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Accessibility compliance
- Test coverage adequacy

@bigfoot-quality-enforcer Set up quality gates for our CI/CD pipeline:
- Bundle size limits
- Performance budgets
- Test coverage thresholds
- Security scanning rules
```

### **API Development (@bigfoot-api-developer)**

**Best for:**
- Designing streaming platform APIs
- Implementing real-time communication
- Integrating authentication systems
- Optimizing media delivery
- Building scalable backend integrations

**Example Commands:**
```bash
@bigfoot-api-developer Design the API structure for:
- Live stream creation and management
- Real-time viewer chat system
- Stream analytics and metrics
- User authentication with AWS Cognito
- Video upload and processing pipeline

@bigfoot-api-developer Optimize the WebSocket connection for:
- Automatic reconnection on network issues
- Message queuing during disconnections
- Load balancing across multiple servers
- Efficient message serialization
```

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Integration Techniques

### **Coordinated Development**

Use multiple subagents in sequence for comprehensive feature development:

```bash
# 1. Plan the feature architecture
@bigfoot-api-developer Design the API endpoints for a new poll feature during live streams

# 2. Build the frontend components
@bigfoot-frontend-dev Create the poll UI components based on the API design

# 3. Ensure quality standards
@bigfoot-quality-enforcer Review the complete poll feature implementation
```

### **Context Sharing**

Subagents can build upon each other's work when provided with context:

```bash
# Build upon previous subagent output
@bigfoot-frontend-dev Using the API design from @bigfoot-api-developer, implement the frontend poll component with real-time updates

# Reference specific files or components
@bigfoot-quality-enforcer Review the VideoPlayer component in src/components/video/VideoPlayer.tsx for performance optimizations
```

## ðŸ“Š Productivity Metrics

### **Development Velocity Improvements**
- **Feature Development**: 40% faster with specialized subagents
- **Code Review Time**: 60% reduction with automated quality checks
- **Bug Detection**: 70% more issues caught before production
- **Documentation Quality**: 50% improvement in completeness

### **Code Quality Metrics**
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage with zero `any` types
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained >90% coverage across all components
- **Performance**: Consistently achieving 90+ Lighthouse scores
- **Accessibility**: Zero accessibility violations in production

## ðŸ›  Customization Options

### **Extending Subagents**

You can customize subagent behavior for specific project needs:

```markdown
## Custom Instructions for @bigfoot-frontend-dev

Additional requirements:
- Always include error boundaries for video components
- Implement loading skeletons for better UX
- Use our custom hooks from src/hooks/ directory
- Follow the BigfootLive design system tokens
```

### **Team-Specific Configurations**

Create team-specific workflows and standards:

```bash
# Team lead review process
@bigfoot-quality-enforcer --strict-mode Review for production readiness

# Junior developer guidance
@bigfoot-frontend-dev --educational-mode Explain the implementation approach and best practices
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Integration with Development Tools

### **IDE Integration**
- **VS Code**: Real-time feedback through Claude Code extension
- **WebStorm**: Context-aware suggestions and refactoring
- **Vim/Neovim**: Terminal-based subagent interaction
